<h2>Description: </h2>
<p>Buttered noodles are simple to make with your favorite pasta, butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper for a quick and easy, kid-friendly dish. Fresh herbs and a little lemon juice could be added to amp up the flavor. Perfect to serve either as-is or alongside steak, chicken, or meatballs. It's such a delicious recipe, yet I get many questions on how to make it.</p>
<h3>Buttered Noodles Ingredients    : </h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Noodles:</strong> This recipe calls for fettuccine noodles, but you could use any noodles you have on hand, from penne to spaghetti.</li>
    <li><strong>Butter:</strong> You can use salted or unsalted butter. Since you'll add more salt at the end, you might want to opt for unsalted (depending on your taste, of course).</li>
    <li><strong>Parmesan:</strong> Grated Parmesan cheese takes this dish up a notch. Buttered noodles don't technically require cheese, so you can leave it out if you want.</li>
    <li><strong>Salt and Pepper:</strong> Finish off this easy buttered noodles recipe with salt and ground black pepper.</li>
</ul>
